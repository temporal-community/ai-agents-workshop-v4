# ABOUTME: Caller-side Nexus service stub for the travel planner — the handler lives in Java.
# The Python orchestrator only needs this interface to build the nexus_operation_as_tool tool.

# Nexus operation I/O. The JSON field names ("question"/"answer") are the
# cross-language wire contract: the Java handler's Jackson POJOs must match
# these exactly. See travel-planner-java/.../TravelPlannerService.java.
