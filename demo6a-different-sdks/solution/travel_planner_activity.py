# ABOUTME: Personal-assistant team's Temporal wrapping of the third-party Strands travel planner.
# The Strands agent itself is unchanged — we just wrap its run() in a single activity.

from temporalio import activity


# Activity: a durable, retryable unit of non-deterministic work (I/O, API calls) — here it wraps an entire third-party agent loop as ONE opaque activity.
